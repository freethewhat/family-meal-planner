Can you please make me a meal plan for a family of 3. The only restriction our family has that meals need to be pre-diabetic friendly. We often cook 2-3 times a week and I need it in this json structure.
Edit

I'll create a pre-diabetic friendly meal plan for your family of 3, using the JSON structure from your document. This plan focuses on lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, plenty of vegetables, and controlled portions to help manage blood sugar levels.

I totally forgot, I really need meals that are quick to make. We have very limited time. I'd like to minimize the process of prepping, cooking, and cleaning. We do have an instant pot, grill, blackstone, sous vide, and standard kitchen appliances.
Edit

I'll redesign your meal plan to focus on ultra-quick, minimal prep meals that are perfect for your busy lifestyle and pre-diabetic needs. Let me leverage your great kitchen equipment to minimize time and cleanup!

Perfect! I've redesigned your meal plan specifically for your time constraints and equipment. Here are the key time-saving features:

Maximum Efficiency Strategies:

    Instant Pot meals: One-pot cooking with minimal cleanup
    Blackstone griddle: Quick cooking, easy cleanup
    Sous vide prep: Cook Sunday, eat Wednesday with 2 minutes effort
    Grill with disposable pans: Zero cleanup
    No-cook options: Assembly only
    Pre-cut/pre-prepped ingredients: Minimize knife work

Pre-Diabetic Benefits:

    Lean proteins (turkey, chicken, salmon, eggs)
    High fiber (beans, vegetables, quinoa)
    Low glycemic vegetables
    Controlled portions of complex carbs
    Minimal added sugars

Time Breakdown:

    Monday-Friday: 5-15 minutes active time
    Saturday: 5 minutes (no cooking)
    Sunday: 20 minutes total (includes leftovers)

The sous vide salmon on Wednesday is genius - you prep it Sunday when you have time, then just reheat Wednesday. The Sunday chili makes great leftovers for lunch too. Would you like me to adjust any specific meals or add more make-ahead options?
